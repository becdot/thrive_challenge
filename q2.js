// In React, create a Counter component that does the following:
// 1. Display a number with a minimum value of 0, and a maximum value of 100
// 2. Increments the counter by 1 when the user clicks an up arrow
// 3. Decreases the counter by 1 when the user clicks a down arrow
// Non-react developers may alternatively use vanilla js
