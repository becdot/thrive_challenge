# Responses to the Thrive challenge!

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to work on these - had a good time with them!

Just a few notes:

### q1
- Added a test at [`q1_test.js`](https://github.com/becdot/thrive_challenge/blob/master/q1_test.js) (can be run with `npm test`)

### q2
- Added a [`q2.html`](https://github.com/becdot/thrive_challenge/blob/master/q2.html) file to test this out
- Added a few TODOs at the top of the file

### q3
- Left inline comments about expected behaviour, along with two possible solutions

### q4
- Added a test at [`q4_test.js`](https://github.com/becdot/thrive_challenge/blob/master/q4_test.js) (which can also be run with `npm test`)
- Added a few TODOs at the top of the file

### Mockup challenge
- Can be viewed at https://becdot.github.io/thrive_challenge/
- Much of the CSS is openly borrowed from [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

**TODOs**
- Image
  - Make image more responsive (currently it won't scale if you make your browser window too wide)
  - Have image snap to a different location when scaling to mobile width
- Fonts
  - Better fonts
  - h2 should be in a different font than the rest of the site
- Table
  - Better spacing (both for description text to the left of table, and centering table within its parent div)
- General
  - Investigate using Flexbox instead of bootstrap
  - Replace HTML with react :)
  - Better hosting (dockerized node app running on AWS??)
